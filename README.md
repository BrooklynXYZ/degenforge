# Ghala - Non-Custodial BTC-Backed DeFi Yield Platform

> **Unlock Your Bitcoin's Earning Potential Without Selling**

Ghala is the first fully non-custodial platform that enables Bitcoin holders to access Solana DeFi yields without wrapping, selling, or giving up control of their Bitcoin. By leveraging Mezo's native BTC-backed stablecoin (mUSD), Internet Computer's chain fusion technology, and Solana's high-performance DeFi ecosystem, Ghala creates a trustless bridge between Bitcoin's security and DeFi's yield opportunities.

## 🎯 The Problem We're Solving

**Bitcoin holders are locked out of DeFi yield opportunities.**

Bitcoin is the most trusted and secure cryptocurrency, holding over $1 trillion in value. However, Bitcoin holders face a fundamental dilemma: their BTC sits idle, generating no yield, while DeFi protocols on other chains offer attractive returns of 5-20% APY.

### Why Current Solutions Fall Short

If you want to earn yield on your Bitcoin today, you're forced to:

1. **Trust Centralized Bridges**
   - Give up custody of your BTC to centralized operators
   - Risk loss from hacks, exploits, or operator misconduct
   - Examples: Wrapped BTC (wBTC) requires BitGo as custodian

2. **Wrap Your Bitcoin**
   - Convert BTC to synthetic tokens on other chains (wBTC, renBTC, tBTC)
   - Pay high fees for bridging (often 0.25-1% per transaction)
   - Accept counterparty risk from the wrapping protocol

3. **Navigate Complex Multi-Step Processes**
   - Manually bridge to Ethereum/other chains
   - Manually interact with DeFi protocols
   - Track positions across multiple wallets and chains
   - High technical barrier for average users

4. **Accept High Costs and Risks**
   - Bridge fees, gas fees, smart contract risks
   - Liquidation risks from complex lending protocols
   - Potential loss of funds during multi-step processes

**The market desperately needs a solution that lets Bitcoin holders keep their BTC while earning DeFi yields - without compromise.**

## 💡 Our Solution: The Ghala Bridge

Ghala solves this problem by creating the first **truly non-custodial** bridge from Bitcoin to Solana DeFi, powered by three innovative technologies working together:

### The Three-Layer Architecture

**Layer 1: Mezo Network (Bitcoin L2)**
- Mezo is a Bitcoin Layer 2 that speaks Bitcoin's language natively
- Users deposit their BTC as collateral on Mezo (staying within the Bitcoin ecosystem)
- Mint mUSD, a stablecoin backed by their BTC, at a fixed low interest rate (~1% APR)
- No wrapping, no conversion - just using Bitcoin as productive collateral

**Layer 2: Internet Computer Protocol (ICP Bridge)**
- ICP acts as the trustless bridge operator between chains
- Uses "chain fusion" technology to directly interact with Bitcoin, Mezo, and Solana
- No centralized operators, no multisig committees, no trusted third parties
- Runs smart contracts (canisters) that orchestrate the entire bridge flow automatically

**Layer 3: Solana DeFi Ecosystem**
- High-performance blockchain with sub-second finality
- Rich ecosystem of yield-generating protocols
- Low transaction fees (fractions of a cent)
- Perfect for deploying stablecoins into productive yield strategies

### How Users Experience Ghala

From a user's perspective, Ghala is beautifully simple:

1. **Open the mobile app** and connect your Bitcoin wallet
2. **Deposit your BTC** to a secure address on Mezo Network
3. **Mint mUSD** - the app automatically mints mUSD stablecoin against your BTC collateral
4. **Bridge to Solana** - one tap bridges your mUSD to Solana
5. **Deploy to yield** - choose a yield strategy and start earning
6. **Track everything** - see your positions, yields, and activity in one clean dashboard

That's it. No technical knowledge required. No manual bridging. No custody risk.

### The Complete Flow (Behind the Scenes)

When a user wants to earn yield on their Bitcoin, here's what happens:

**Step 1: Collateral Deposit**
- User sends BTC to Mezo Network (Bitcoin L2)
- BTC is locked in Mezo's borrowing protocol
- User maintains ownership - they can withdraw anytime by repaying their loan

**Step 2: Stablecoin Minting**
- User mints mUSD against their BTC collateral
- mUSD is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to USD
- Over-collateralized (users must maintain healthy collateral ratios)
- Fixed ~1% annual interest rate (far cheaper than most lending protocols)

**Step 3: Bridge Initiation**
- User requests to bridge mUSD to Solana
- ICP Bridge Orchestrator canister receives the request
- Verifies user's position and mUSD balance

**Step 4: Cross-Chain Coordination**
- Bridge canister communicates with Mezo Network via HTTPS
- Verifies the mUSD mint and locks it for bridging
- Coordinates with Solana canister to prepare destination

**Step 5: Solana Delivery**
- Solana canister mints wrapped mUSD on Solana
- Delivers directly to user's Solana wallet
- User now has mUSD on Solana, ready for DeFi

**Step 6: Yield Deployment**
- User selects a yield strategy
- mUSD is deployed into Solana DeFi protocols
- User earns yield while their BTC remains safely collateralized on Mezo

**Step 7: Exit Strategy**
- User can withdraw from yield protocols anytime
- Bridge mUSD back from Solana to Mezo
- Repay mUSD loan and unlock their original BTC
- Full circle, fully non-custodial

## 🌟 What Makes Ghala Unique

### 1. True Non-Custodial Design

**Other Bridges**: Require you to send BTC to a centralized custodian or multisig wallet.

**Ghala**: Your BTC never leaves your control. It stays in Mezo's smart contracts, which you control. You can always reclaim your BTC by repaying your mUSD loan - no permission needed from any centralized entity.

### 2. Native Bitcoin Integration

**Other Solutions**: Wrap your Bitcoin into synthetic tokens (wBTC, renBTC) that trade on other chains.

**Ghala**: Uses Mezo's native BTC collateral system. Your real Bitcoin stays in the Bitcoin ecosystem (via Mezo L2), backing your mUSD 1:1. No wrapping, no synthetic derivatives.

### 3. Trustless Bridge Technology

**Other Bridges**: Operated by centralized companies, multisig committees, or validator networks that can be compromised.

**Ghala**: Uses Internet Computer's chain fusion technology. ICP canisters (smart contracts) are completely autonomous, tamper-proof, and run without any centralized operators. They directly interact with Bitcoin, Mezo, and Solana through decentralized consensus.

### 4. Seamless User Experience

**Other Solutions**: Require technical expertise, multiple wallets, manual bridging, and complex DeFi interactions.

**Ghala**: Mobile-first design with one-tap operations. Everything automated behind the scenes. Users just see: Deposit → Mint → Bridge → Earn. Simple.

### 5. Low Fixed Interest Rate

**Other Lending Protocols**: Variable interest rates that can spike to 10-30% during market stress.

**Ghala**: Fixed ~1% APR on mUSD minting. Predictable costs. Users keep most of their earned yield.

### 6. Bitcoin → Solana Pathway

**Most DeFi**: Concentrated on Ethereum, with high gas fees ($20-100 per transaction).

**Ghala**: Bridges to Solana, where transactions cost less than $0.01. Enables micro-yield strategies and frequent rebalancing without fee concerns.

### 7. Automated Position Management

**Traditional DeFi**: Users must manually monitor collateral ratios, rebalance positions, claim rewards, and manage liquidation risks.

**Ghala** (Roadmap): Intelligent automation that monitors positions, alerts users to risks, and can auto-rebalance to maintain healthy collateralization.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

Ghala is built on four major components that work together seamlessly:

### 1. Mobile Application

**Technology**: React Native with Expo for cross-platform iOS and Android support.

**What It Does**:
- Provides the user interface for all operations
- Integrates with multiple blockchain wallets (WalletConnect for Bitcoin/Ethereum, Phantom/Solflare for Solana)
- Implements biometric authentication for security
- Displays real-time positions across all chains
- Manages transaction lifecycle and status updates

**Key Features**:
- **Mint Screen**: Deposit BTC and mint mUSD
- **Bridge Screen**: Transfer mUSD from Mezo to Solana
- **Pool Screen**: Browse and select yield strategies
- **Activity Screen**: Track all transactions and history
- **Profile Screen**: Manage wallet connections and settings

**Why Mobile-First**: Most crypto users access DeFi through mobile devices. Desktop-only solutions create barriers. Ghala brings institutional-grade DeFi to your pocket.

### 2. Backend API Server

**Technology**: Node.js with TypeScript and Express framework.

**What It Does**:
- Acts as the gateway to Mezo Network
- Manages user authentication and sessions
- Executes smart contract calls to Mezo's mUSD protocol
- Calculates collateral ratios and maximum mintable amounts
- Tracks user loan positions and health factors
- Provides price oracle data (BTC/USD pricing)

**Why It's Needed**: Mezo Network uses Ethereum-compatible RPC endpoints. The backend abstracts this complexity, providing simple REST APIs to the mobile app. It also handles authentication and security middleware to protect user operations.

### 3. ICP Bridge Canisters

**Technology**: Rust-based smart contracts (canisters) running on Internet Computer Protocol.

**What They Do**:

**BTC Handler Canister**:
- Generates Bitcoin addresses for each user
- Monitors Bitcoin testnet for deposits
- Tracks transaction confirmations
- Manages UTXO (Bitcoin's transaction model)
- Handles Bitcoin address derivation using chain fusion technology

**Bridge Orchestrator Canister**:
- Coordinates the entire bridge flow
- Communicates with Mezo Network via HTTPS outcalls
- Tracks user positions (BTC deposited, mUSD minted, assets bridged)
- Enforces the closed-loop architecture (only internally-minted mUSD can be bridged)
- Calculates loan-to-value ratios and liquidation risks
- Provides bridge statistics and monitoring

**Solana Handler Canister**:
- Generates Solana addresses for users
- Creates and signs Solana transactions
- Handles SPL token operations (Solana's token standard)
- Mints wrapped mUSD on Solana
- Delivers assets to user wallets
- Monitors transaction finality on Solana

**Why ICP**: Internet Computer is the only blockchain that can natively interact with Bitcoin, make HTTPS calls to external APIs (like Mezo), and sign transactions on other chains (like Solana) - all in a completely decentralized manner. This eliminates the need for centralized bridge operators.

**Closed-Loop Security Architecture**:

The Bridge Orchestrator implements a critical security feature: only mUSD that was minted through Ghala's deposit flow can be bridged to Solana. This means:

- ✅ BTC deposited through Ghala → mUSD minted → Can be bridged to Solana
- ❌ mUSD minted externally → Cannot be bridged through Ghala

**Why this matters**: This design ensures that every mUSD bridged through Ghala has verified BTC collateral backing it. It prevents exploitation, maintains accurate accounting of collateralization ratios, and provides complete auditability. Users can trust that the system is solvent and secure.

### 4. mUSD Protocol Contracts

**Technology**: Solidity smart contracts deployed on Mezo Network.

**What They Do**:
- Implement the mUSD stablecoin (ERC20 token)
- Manage collateral deposits and withdrawals
- Handle minting and burning of mUSD
- Track individual debt positions (called "Troves")
- Implement liquidation mechanisms for undercollateralized positions
- Manage a stability pool for system solvency
- Integrate with price oracles for accurate BTC/USD pricing

**Why Mezo**: Mezo is a Bitcoin Layer 2 that allows smart contracts while maintaining native Bitcoin compatibility. Users can deposit BTC without wrapping or leaving the Bitcoin security model.

### 5. Bridge Event Listener

**Technology**: TypeScript service running continuously.

**What It Does**:
- Listens for bridge events on Mezo Network
- Detects when mUSD is locked for bridging
- Automatically mints equivalent wrapped mUSD on Solana
- Handles decimal conversions (Mezo uses 18 decimals, Solana uses 6)
- Ensures 1:1 peg between Mezo mUSD and Solana wrapped mUSD

**Why It's Needed**: This service acts as the relay between Mezo and Solana, ensuring that when mUSD is locked on Mezo, the equivalent amount appears on Solana. It maintains the bridge's integrity and liquidity on both sides.
